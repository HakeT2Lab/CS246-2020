data = [a, b, c, d, e]
save=  [a, b, c, d, e]  Travrsed thru DataIdxCount = 5

addon = [f, g, h, i, j] Traversed AddonIsxCount = 5 Is currently pointing at 'J'

While Data != NULL


tmp= empty linked list
saveCount= 0

   
1st trigger 
    SaveCount is = 0 so it goes to else and is !=  to Data/count/2 (2 in this case)
    1) Creates a new node in tmp(using helper function)
         and makes it = to the next node of data which is 'B'





    saveCOunt =1
2nd

    tmp goes to next node
    tmp = a, b
    saveCOunt
triggers If condiction
    tmp = a , b, {}
