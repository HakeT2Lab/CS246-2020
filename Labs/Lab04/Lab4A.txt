/*
Your objective is to write an array trace table of the array below for one of the three sorting methods (bubble sort,
insertion sort or selection sort) discussed in the sorting lecture. The table should illustrate the swaps that will occur to
the array when it is the argument for the sorting method. Make sure to indicate which method the table is implementing.

Bubble Sort


(x , y) Swaped numbers
